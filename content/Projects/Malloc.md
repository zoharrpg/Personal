CMU 15213 Malloc Lab

In this lab you will write a dynamic memory allocator which will consist of the malloc, free, realloc, and
calloc functions. Your goal is to implement an allocator that is correct, efficient, and fast.
We strongly encourage you to start early. The total time you spend designing and debugging can easily
eclipse the time you spend coding.
Bugs can be especially pernicious and difficult to track down in an allocator, and you will probably spend
a significant amount of time debugging your code. Buggy code will not get any credit.
This lab has been heavily revised from previous versions. Do not rely on advice or information you may
find on the Web or from people who have done this lab before. It will most likely be misleading or outright
wrong.1 Be sure to read all of the documentation carefully and especially study the baseline implementation
we have provided.
