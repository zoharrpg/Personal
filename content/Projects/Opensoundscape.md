OpenSoundscape is free and open source software for the analysis of bioacoustic recordings (GitHub). Its main goals are to allow users to train their own custom species classification models using a variety of frameworks (including convolutional neural networks) and to use trained models to predict whether species are present in field recordings. OpSo can be installed and run on a single computer or in a cluster or cloud environment.

OpenSoundcape is developed and maintained by the Kitzes Lab at the University of Pittsburgh.

The Installation section below provides guidance on installing OpSo. The Tutorials pages below are written as Jupyter Notebooks that can also be downloaded from the project repository on GitHub.
