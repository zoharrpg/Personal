A proxy server is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between clients making requests to access
resources and the servers that satisfy those requests by serving content. A web proxy is a special type of proxy
server whose clients are typically web browsers and whose servers are web servers providing web content.
When a web browser uses a proxy, it contacts the proxy instead of communicating directly with the web
server; the proxy forwards the client’s request to the web server, reads the server’s response, then forwards the
response to the client.
