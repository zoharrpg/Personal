A cache simulator is a program which simulates the behavior of a cache given a series of memory operations (loads and stores). The series of memory operations is called a trace.
In this part of the lab, you will write three traces that should produce specific types of cache behavior. We have provided you with a simulator (csim-ref) to test the traces with, but you must write them in the format it expects.
